# Clinical Integration

This project is designed to integrate with clinical radiotherapy workflows, enabling the use of synthetic CT images within existing treatment planning systems.

## Integration with Treatment Planning Systems (TPS)

The synthetic CT generation system provides integration with common radiotherapy treatment planning systems:
- **Eclipse** (Varian Medical Systems)
- **RayStation** (RaySearch Laboratories)
- **Monaco** (Elekta)
- **Pinnacle** (Philips)

Data exchange is supported through standard DICOM-RT objects:
- DICOM CT images
- DICOM RT Structure Sets
- DICOM RT Dose objects
- DICOM RT Plans

## Clinical Workflow

The project supports several MRI-only radiotherapy workflows:

1. **MRI-only simulation**:
   - MRI acquisition using simulation protocols
   - Synthetic CT generation from MRI
   - Target delineation on MRI
   - Treatment planning on synthetic CT

2. **Adaptive replanning**:
   - Daily or weekly MRI acquisition
   - Rapid synthetic CT generation
   - Plan adaptation based on current anatomy
   - Fast dose recalculation

3. **Combined MR-CT planning**:
   - CT for initial planning
   - MRI for improved soft tissue visualization
   - Registration of MRI to CT
   - Synthetic CT for adaptation or verification

## Clinical Validation

The system has undergone various levels of clinical validation:
- **Geometric validation**: Accuracy of anatomical structures
- **Dosimetric validation**: Accuracy of dose calculation
- **Workflow validation**: Integration with clinical processes
- **Expert validation**: Radiologist and oncologist assessment

## Implementation Details

Key components for clinical integration include:
- [app/utils/dicom_export.py](mdc:app/utils/dicom_export.py): DICOM export utilities
- [app/utils/tps_integration.py](mdc:app/utils/tps_integration.py): Treatment planning system integration
- [app/core/evaluation/dosimetric_validation.py](mdc:app/core/evaluation/dosimetric_validation.py): Dose calculation validation

## Regulatory Considerations

The system is designed with attention to regulatory requirements:
- Clear documentation of algorithms and processes
- Comprehensive validation protocols
- Quality assurance processes
- Audit trails for synthetic CT generation

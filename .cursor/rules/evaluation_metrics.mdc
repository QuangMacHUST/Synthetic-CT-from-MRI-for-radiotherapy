# Evaluation Metrics and Quality Assurance

This project implements comprehensive evaluation metrics to assess the quality of synthetic CT (sCT) images generated from MRI.

## Quantitative Metrics

The following metrics are used to quantitatively compare synthetic CT with reference CT:

- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Average absolute difference in HU values
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: Average of squared differences in HU values
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Square root of MSE
- **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**: Ratio between maximum signal power and noise power
- **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)**: Perceptual metric that considers luminance, contrast and structure

## Region-Specific Analysis

Evaluation is performed separately for different tissue types:
- **Bone regions**: Critical for accurate dose calculation
- **Soft tissue regions**: Important for target volume delineation
- **Air cavities**: Significant impact on dose distribution

## Dose Comparison

For radiotherapy applications, the following dose-related metrics are implemented:
- **Gamma analysis**: Combined distance and dose difference criteria
- **DVH (Dose Volume Histogram) comparison**: Comparing dose distribution statistics
- **Dose difference maps**: Visualizing spatial distribution of dose differences

## Quality Assurance (QA)

Automated QA processes ensure reliable synthetic CT generation:
- Automatic detection of regions with high uncertainty
- Warning system for potential conversion errors
- Quality scoring for overall synthetic CT reliability

## Visualization Tools

The system includes visualization tools for evaluation results:
- Side-by-side comparison of real vs synthetic CT
- Difference maps highlighting discrepancies
- Overlay views for anatomical assessment

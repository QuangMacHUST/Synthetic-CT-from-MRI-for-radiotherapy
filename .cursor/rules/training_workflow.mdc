# Training Workflow

This project includes a comprehensive training workflow for developing models that convert MRI images to synthetic CT.

## Training Pipeline

The training pipeline consists of several stages:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Collection of paired MRI-CT datasets
   - Preprocessing of images (normalization, registration)
   - Dataset splitting (training, validation, test)
   - Augmentation strategy definition

2. **Model Training**:
   - Training of segmentation models
   - Training of conversion models (Atlas, CNN, GAN)
   - Hyperparameter optimization
   - Model evaluation during training

3. **Model Validation**:
   - Comprehensive evaluation on validation set
   - Comparison with reference CT
   - Region-specific performance analysis
   - Clinical acceptability assessment

4. **Model Deployment**:
   - Conversion to optimized format
   - Integration with runtime pipeline
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Version management

## Training Infrastructure

The training system supports various computational environments:
- **Local workstations**: For small-scale development
- **HPC clusters**: For large-scale training
- **Cloud platforms**: For scalable deployment

## Dataset Management

The training workflow includes robust dataset management:
- **Data versioning**: Tracking dataset versions
- **Data splits**: Consistent training/validation/test splits
- **Augmentation pipelines**: Consistent data augmentation
- **Cross-validation**: Support for k-fold cross-validation

## Implementation

Key components for the training workflow include:
- [app/training/train_segmentation.py](mdc:app/training/train_segmentation.py): Segmentation model training
- [app/training/train_conversion.py](mdc:app/training/train_conversion.py): Conversion model training
- [app/training/datasets.py](mdc:app/training/datasets.py): Dataset handling for training

## Model Selection and Ensemble

The training workflow supports:
- **Automatic model selection**: Based on validation metrics
- **Model ensembling**: Combining multiple trained models
- **Transfer learning**: Using pre-trained models as starting points
- **Domain adaptation**: Adapting models to new anatomical regions

# Error Handling and Recovery

This project implements robust error handling and recovery mechanisms to ensure reliable operation of the synthetic CT generation pipeline in clinical settings.

## Error Detection

The system employs multiple error detection mechanisms:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Verification of DICOM header information
   - Image dimension and spacing validation
   - MRI sequence type detection and validation
   - Image quality assessment

2. **Processing Monitoring**:
   - Progress tracking for long-running operations
   - Resource usage monitoring (memory, GPU)
   - Execution time tracking for performance bottlenecks
   - Intermediate result validation

3. **Output Verification**:
   - Synthetic CT quality assessment
   - Anatomical consistency verification
   - Dosimetric plausibility checks
   - DICOM compliance validation

## Error Handling Strategies

The system implements several error handling strategies:

- **Graceful degradation**: Falling back to alternative methods when optimal approaches fail
- **Automatic retry**: Retrying operations with adjusted parameters
- **Checkpointing**: Saving intermediate results for resumable processing
- **Detailed logging**: Recording comprehensive information for troubleshooting

## Recovery Mechanisms

Recovery from errors is managed through:

1. **Pipeline Recovery**:
   - Resuming processing from last successful checkpoint
   - Alternative processing paths for different error scenarios
   - Automatic parameter adjustment for retry attempts
   - Manual intervention points for complex errors

2. **Data Recovery**:
   - Backup of input and intermediate data
   - Version control for processing states
   - Audit trails for all processing steps
   - Data consistency checks during recovery

## Implementation

Key components for error handling include:
- [app/utils/error_handling.py](mdc:app/utils/error_handling.py): Error handling utilities
- [app/utils/logging.py](mdc:app/utils/logging.py): Comprehensive logging system
- [app/core/pipeline_recovery.py](mdc:app/core/pipeline_recovery.py): Pipeline recovery mechanisms

## User Feedback

The system provides informative feedback about errors:
- **GUI error notifications**: User-friendly error messages
- **Detailed logs**: Comprehensive information for technical users
- **Suggested actions**: Recommendations for resolving issues
- **Error classification**: Categorization of errors by severity and type
